new_title = "lorde" + "" + "justin"

# Give yourself a fancy title. But this time include the space in the first string. So you'll be concatenating the title and space as the first string, and your first name as the second string. Assign the result to a variable. Make up the variable name.

# In a single statement, tell Python to display the concatenation of two variables. Make up the variable names.

# code a single line, using the two variables plus a string between them, that displays Hello, World!
